                <b>HTML</b>
                <br>
                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 

                HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.

                <b>CSS</b>
                <br>
                Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

				while html uses tags, css uses rulesets.
				CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

				<b>Benefits Of CSS</b>
			</div>
			<p class="text">
				1) Faster Page Speed
                   More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.
                   <br>
                2) Better User Experience
                   CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves.
                   <br>
                3) Quicker Development Time
                    One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.
                    <br>
                4) Easy Formatting Changes
                   If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.
                   <br>
                5) Compatibility Across Devices
                   Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices.

            <b>CSS  selector</b>
			</div>
			<p class="text">
				CSS selectors are used to select the content you want to style. Selectors are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selectors select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc.
                <br>
                There are several different types of selectors in CSS.
                <br>
              
                CSS Element Selector
                <br>
                CSS Id Selector
                <br>
                CSS Class Selector
                <br>
                CSS Universal Selector
                <br>
                CSS Group Selector
                 <br>


                 1) CSS Element Selector
                    The element selector selects the HTML element by name.
                <br><br>

                2) CSS Id Selector
                    The id selector selects the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. An id is always unique within the page so it is chosen to select a single, unique element.
                    It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the id of the element.
                    <br><br>


                3) CSS Class Selector
                   The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. It is used with a period character . (full stop symbol) followed by the class name.
                    Note: A class name should not be started with a number.
                    <br><br>

                4) CSS Universal Selector
                   The universal selector is used as a wildcard character. It selects all the elements on the pages.
                   <br><br>
                
                   5) CSS Group Selector
                      The grouping selector is used to select all the elements with the same style definitions.

                     Grouping selector is used to minimize the code. Commas are used to separate each selector in grouping.
